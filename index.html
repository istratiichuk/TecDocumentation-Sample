          <p>Our aim with English File fourth edition has been to make every lesson better and to make the package more studentand teacher-friendly. As well as the main A, B, C Student’s Book lessons, there is a range of material that you can use according to your students’ needs, and the time and resources you have available. Don’t forget to use these resources:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>videos that can be used in class in every File: Practical English, Video Listening, and Can you understand
these people?</li>
            <li>Quick Tests and File Tests for every File, as well as Progress Tests, an End-of-course Test, and an Entry Test, which you can use at the beginning of the course</li>
            <li>photocopiable Grammar and Communicative activities for every A, B, C lesson, and a Vocabulary activity for every Vocabulary Bank</li>
          </ul>
          <p><code>Online Practice</code> and the Workbook provide review, support, and practice for students outside the class. The <code>Teacher’s Guide</code> suggests different ways of exploiting the Student’s Book depending on the level of your class. We very much hope you enjoy using English File fourth edition.</p>
          <p>We believe that in 9 out of 10 cases when a student signs up
for English classes, their goal is to speak. Speaking a foreign
language is very hard, so students need a great deal of
motivation to encourage them to speak in English.</p>

             </ul>
             <p>We have tried to provide contexts for new language that
will engage students, using real-life stories and situations,
humour, and suspense. The <code>Grammar Banks</code> give students
a single, easy-to-access grammar reference section, with
example sentences with audio, clear rules, and common
errors. There are at least two practice exercises for each
grammar point. Students can look again at the grammar
presented in the lesson on Online Practice. The Workbook
provides a variety of practice exercises and the opportunity
for students to use the new grammar to express their
own ideas.</p>

               <li>Accessible reference material</li>
             </ul>
             <p>Every lesson focuses on high frequency vocabulary and
common lexical areas, but keeps the load realistic. All new
vocabulary is given with the phonemic script alongside, to
help students with the pronunciation of new words.
Many lessons are linked to the <code>Vocabulary Banks</code> which
help present and practise the vocabulary in class, give an
audio model of each word, and provide a clear reference so
students can revise and test themselves in their own time.
Students can review the meaning and the pronunciation of
new vocabulary on Online Practice, and find further practice
in the Workbook.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>A1/A2 level learners are often frustrated by English
pronunciation, particularly the sound–spelling relationships,
silent letters, and weak forms. There is a pronunciation focus
in every lesson, which integrates clear pronunciation into
grammar and vocabulary practice. There is an emphasis on
the sounds most useful for communication, on word stress,
and on sentence rhythm. <code>Online Practice</code> contains the Sound
Bank videos which show students the mouth positions to
make English vowels and consonants. They can also review
the pronunciation from the lesson at their own speed. There
is more practice of pronunciation in the Workbook, with
audio, which can be found on Online Practice.</p>

               <p>The listenings in English File are based on a variety of
entertaining and realistic situations. The tasks focus on
helping students to get the gist on the first listen and then
being able to understand more the second time. On Online
Practice, for each File students can find further listening
practice related to the topic. They can also access the
listening activities from every lesson, to practise in their own
time, and to read the script to check anything that they have
found difficult.</p>

               <p>English File motivates students to speak by providing varied
and achievable tasks, and the language (G + V + P) that they
need in order to communicate with confidence. In addition
to the Speaking stage, students are encouraged to speak all
through each lesson, responding to texts and listenings,
and practising grammar and vocabulary orally. Every two
Files, students can use Online Practice to record themselves
doing a short task.</p>

               </ul>
               <p>Many students need to read in English for their work
or studies, and reading is also important in helping to
build vocabulary and to consolidate grammar. The key to
encouraging students to read is to give them motivating
but accessible material and tasks they can do. In English File
A1/A2 reading texts have been adapted from a variety of real
sources (the British press, magazines, news websites) and
have been chosen for their intrinsic interest and ability to
generate discussion.</p>

               <p>The growth of the internet and email means that people
worldwide are writing in English more than ever before
both for business and personal communication. English File
A1/A2 provides guided writing tasks covering a range
of writing types from a formal email to a social media
post. Students can use Online Practice to develop their
writing skills further. The Discussion board also provides
opportunities for informal written interaction.</p>
